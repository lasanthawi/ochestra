# Aileen - AI Code Generation Platform

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/lasanthawi/ochestra)

Full stack application codegen platform.

## About

Aileen is a vibe-coding/code-generation platform that builds Next.js applications with Neon databases based on natural language prompts.

Each Aileen project is a standalone, version-controlled Next.js application with its own Neon database that is fully developed and managed by the Aileen agent.

You can find a detailed blog post about Aileen [here](https://neon.com/blog/how-to-build-a-full-stack-ai-agent).

### Key Features

- Creates projects with automated database, authentication, and development server setup
- Manages project versions with database snapshots and version control
- Provides an AI chat interface for collaborative development
- Orchestrates complex initialization workflows using Vercel Workflows
- Tracks and manages environment secrets per project version

### Platform Setup

The platform is a Next.js app hosted on Vercel. The [Workflow Development Kit](https://useworkflow.dev/) is used for background tasks. Bun is used as the TypeScript runtime and package manager.

The following services and infra providers are used to build the platform:

- **Neon** - Serverless Postgres database for storing users, projects, project versions, and project secrets
- **Neon Auth** - Platform user authentication powered by Stack Auth
- **Assistant UI** - AI chat interface with conversation persistence
- **Mastra** - AI agents framework & hosting
- **Vercel** - Platform hosting provider (Next.js hosting & background tasks)

### Per-Project Setup

Each codegen project is initialized using an opinionated starter template w/ Next.js, Drizzle ORM, Neon Postgres, Neon Auth, and Shadcn/ui pre-configured. This helps the agent focus on feature development rather than infrastructure setup. You can find the starter template here: [github.com/andrelandgraf/neon-freestyle-template](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/neon-freestyle-template).

Each created project includes the following provisioned resources/services:

- **Neon Database** - Dedicated Postgres instance
- **Neon Auth** - Authentication configured by default, dev server domain allowlisted through Neon Auth API
- **Freestyle** - Development server (sandbox) and git repository

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run Aileen locally:

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you must create accounts with the following services and obtain the required API credentials. Refer to `.env.example` for the required environment variables.

Services:

- [Assistant UI](https://assistant-ui.com/)
  - Create an Assistant UI account and project
- [Freestyle](https://freestyle.sh/)
  - Create a Freestyle account and project
- [Neon](https://neon.com/)
  - Create a Neon account and project
  - Initialize Neon Auth and obtain the Neon Auth credentials
  - Create an organization API key to manage codegen project databases
- [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/)
  - Obtain a Claude API key (Haiku 4.5 is used by default)

### Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your API keys from the services above:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

All required environment variables are documented in `.env.example`.

**Encryption**: Stored project secrets and API keys are encrypted at rest. You need to set the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable for this. Generate a new encryption key by running `bun run scripts/get-encryption-key.ts`.

### Installation

```bash
bun install
```

### Initialize Database

Use Drizzle ORM to initialize the platform database:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

### Development

Aileen runs on two separate servers in development. The Mastra server must be running concurrently for code-generation capabilities.

Run the web server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Run the Mastra agent server:

```bash
bun run mastra:dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

### One-click Vercel deployment (recommended)

Use the **Deploy with Vercel** button above to import and deploy this repository in one flow.

This repository is configured for Bun builds on Vercel via `vercel.json` and `bun run vercel:build`.

The build script supports guarded database migrations:

- `RUN_DB_MIGRATIONS=1` → run `db:migrate` during build
- unset or any other value → skip migrations
- If Stack Auth env vars are missing at build time, `vercel:build` injects temporary placeholders to avoid static generation crashes; set real values in Vercel project envs for runtime auth to work.

Recommended first deploy flow:

1. Set required env vars in Vercel project settings
2. Temporarily set `RUN_DB_MIGRATIONS=1`
3. Deploy once
4. Set `RUN_DB_MIGRATIONS=0` (or remove it) for regular redeploys

### Split deployment option

If you prefer to keep agents separately hosted, you can deploy Next.js on Vercel and run Mastra separately.

For complete platform docs, refer to [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs).

## Aileen in Production

In production, you likely want to have two separate Neon organizations:

- **Company Organization** - Hosts the Aileen platform database (users, projects, versions, secrets)
- **Multi-Tenant Agent Organization** - Hosts all agent-managed codegen application databases

This separation provides better resource isolation, cost tracking, and management of the agent-created databases. For detailed information about scaling agent platforms on Neon, see [Neon for AI Agent Platforms](https://neon.com/agents).
